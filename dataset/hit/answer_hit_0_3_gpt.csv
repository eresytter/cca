"okay. hit. whoops. you missed.

Since the context is minimal and the sentences are fragmented, it's challenging to provide precise annotations. However, based on the patterns provided, here's an attempt:

- okay. hit. = This is too vague to annotate without additional context.
- whoops. = This is an interjection and doesn't involve the verb ""hit.""
- you missed. = This implies an action related to hitting but doesn't explicitly use the verb ""hit.""

Given the lack of context, specific annotations cannot be accurately assigned."
