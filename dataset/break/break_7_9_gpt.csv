beehive fell down and broke.
the dog fell and the bottle broke.
the dog broke it.
the beehive fell and broke.
the dog jumped out and broke the glass.
when the dog broke the beehouse.
and then it broke.
The dog fell and the jar broke.
the jar broke.
And the glass broke open.
he broke the glass with his head.
hey break it up you two!
the glass broke.
The dog fell and broke the cage.
It fell down and broke.
he broke the jar on him.
The beehive broke.
the dog fell down and broke the bowl.
the dog fall and broke the glass.
it fell to the floor and broke.
when he fell he broke it.
the dog broke the beehive.
because he had broken the jar.
and the glass jar broke.
the bowl broke.
